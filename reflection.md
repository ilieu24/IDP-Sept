This was one of my favorite things I have created so far. I had honestly no clue how to use P5, and really pushed through during this project. The things I changed mostly just had to do with orginazation. Previously, much of my project was dont in the index.html page, which is very hard because all of my code was all over the place and icorectly spaced out. I fixed the spacing and made the code easier to read and hopefully esaier to understand. The project really showed who I am; I tried to create a fun game that was visually appealing and also almost relaxing.
